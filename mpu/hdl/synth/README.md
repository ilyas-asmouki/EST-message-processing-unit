# Synthesis / Implementation

Vendor projects and batch scripts land here. For example:
- `vivado/` – block design Tcl, run scripts, and reports for Xilinx targets.
- `quartus/` – project files and scripts for Intel devices.

Checkpoints, bitstreams, and tool caches should be directed to `build/` (see repo root) so this tree stays lightweight.
