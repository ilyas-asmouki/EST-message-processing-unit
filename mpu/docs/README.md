# Documentation

This directory captures design notes, interface specs, and block-level requirements for the FPGA implementation. Use it to mirror the decisions made in the Python golden model (e.g., coding parameters, bit-growth budgets, clock/reset planning) so RTL/testbench work stays aligned with the reference pipeline.
